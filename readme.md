1001-js
=======

I'm having fun making the famous 1001 game in canvas. This is a slow WIP, working on it whenever I can, dealing with problems as they come.

Note to myself : the name should be 1010 :sweat_smile:

So far :
--------

* Display grid
* Display 3 random pieces
* Add a click event on pieces based on their bounding box
* Possible to move the pieces around and drop them on board. They snap to the grid
* Drop conditions
  * Don't if a part of it is out the board
  * Don't if another piece is under
* Create 3 more pieces when the other are dropped
* Lines conpletion


Todo
-----

* Piece random angle (0, 90, 180, 270) for more variety
* Points
* Calculate that no move is possible -> game is lost
