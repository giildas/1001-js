1001-js
=======

I'm having fun making the famous 1001 game in canvas. This is a slow WIP, working on it whenever I can, dealing with problems as they come.

Note to myself : the name should be 1010 :sweat_smile:

So far : 
--------

* Display grid
* Display 3 random pieces
* Add a click event on pieces based on their bounding box

Todo
-----

* everything else !
